# Note taking app

This is a note taking app I made in a team of three during Week 7 at Makers Academy.
We used vanilla Javascript to create a single page application with testing (TDD) without a testing framework. 

## Instructions

Take user stories for a notes app. Use them to build a frontend, single page web app.

You can't use existing web frameworks, libraries or even a test library (e.g. no Angular, React, Jasmine, jQuery etc.).

No challenges. No walkthroughs.

Guidance
Make sure to look at this guidance on building a frontend, single page app! It'll help you point yourself in the right direction when you're figuring out how to implement some of the trickier things.

Test library
Extract your own test library from your app. See here for more guidance on testing without a testing library and extracting your testing code into its own library.
